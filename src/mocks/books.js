                "description": "When traditional web development techniques don't cut it, try React. Use React to create highly interactive web pages faster and with fewer errors. With a little JavaScript experience under your belt, you'll be up and running in no time creating dynamic web applications. Craft isolated components that make your apps easier to develop and maintain, with plenty of guidance on best practices. Set up automated tests, and make pages render fast for your users. See how to use your React skills to integrate with other front-end technologies when needed. Dive right into React by defining components, the basic building blocks of a React application. Integrate modern JavaScript language features such as classes and arrow functions in your app. Analyze the relationships in your data to isolate state, and sync the data model with what your users see. Once you're familiar with how a React application works, organize your code base with modules. Configure a production build and deliver your app as efficiently as possible with Webpack. Master testing with React-specific advice and tools to catch the most bugs with the least amount of code. Learn the basics of the Redux library. Define actions and manage an immutable central state with reducers, then connect Redux to your React components to build even larger and more complex interfaces. Package your React code as a standalone widget so anyone can use it in their own applications. Reuse existing JavaScript code in your React components, and build a new React view on top of an existing data model shared with a legacy application. When you finish this book, you'll be well on your way to solving your front-end problems with React. What You Need: Node.js 6.x or later, and a modern web browser.",

                "description": "My fourth web development book is simply called React.js Book. It will walk you step by step through the process of setting up a development environment and learning Reactive programming from start to finish. React is a library unlike any other I have worked with. Unlike jQuery where you had to learn a number of methods that do very specific things, it's largely inspired by a programming methodology for creating fast web applications.In addition you will be expected to know or at least be briefly familiar with prerequisite knowledge of other web development tools such as Node.js, NPM, Babel, JSX and WebPack. These are not required elements of programming with React, but without them things would be tough.As of 2017, Reactive programming is an alternative way of thinking about web applications. It provides software patterns that make your web app extremely responsive to user input and generally feel faster to the end-user (people who are using your application.) The Virtual DOM alone is enough of a reason to switch to React. Programming with React library, is a lot more than just learning about and using React objects, components, states, props and methods. It requires previous experience with JavaScript and at times assumes knowledge of software principles not inherent to React library itself.This book is not a list of object names, methods and functions with side explanations of what they do. Rather, it deals with the said principles involved in React programming thought up by the creators of React library. Principles that are usually understood by professional web developers and software engineers.For all these reasons stated above, this book will gradually walk you through the process of becoming familiar with React library, starting from basic concepts. Gradually, we will move toward more advanced subjects. So, prepare to be educated",

Everything from project setup to deployment on a server will be explained. The book comes with additional referenced reading material and exercises with each chapter. After reading the book, you will be able to build your own applications in React. The material is kept up to date by me and the community.In the Road to learn React, I want to offer a foundation before you start to dive into the broader React ecosystem. It has less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information around React. It explains general concepts, patterns and best practices in a real world React application.You will learn to build your own React application. It covers real world features like pagination, client-side caching and interactions like searching and sorting. Additionally you will transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6 along the way. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript and helps you to get started.",

This important new book shows you how you can protect yourself regardless of your age, sex or level of fitness by using the simple but effective REACT formula: R: Recognise E: Evaluate A: Alternatives C: Concentrate T: Terminate Using clear and concise step-by-step instructions, reinforced with many illustrations and diagrams, each of these five basic principles is expanded and explained in such a way that they quickly become 'second nature'. Following this sequence in any circumstance will allow you to recognise potential threats, decide on the best form of action to take and equip you carry to this through. While The R.E.A.C.T.

They enable you to build simple and concise React.js applications, along with helping you avoid using wrapper components in your applications, making it easy to refactor code. This React book starts by introducing you to React Hooks. You will then get to grips with building a complex UI in React while keeping the code simple and extensible. Next, you will quickly move on to building your first applications with React Hooks. In the next few chapters, the book delves into various Hooks, including the State and Effect Hooks. After covering State Hooks and understanding how to use them, you will focus on the capabilities of Effect Hooks for adding advanced functionality to React apps. You will later explore the Suspense and Context APIs and how they can be used with Hooks. Toward the concluding chapters, you will learn how to integrate Redux and MobX with React Hooks. Finally, the book will help you develop the skill of migrating your existing React class components, and Redux and MobX web applications to Hooks. By the end of this book, you will be well-versed in building your own custom Hooks and effectively refactoring your React applications. What you will learn Understand the fundamentals of React Hooks and how they modernize state management in React apps Build your own custom Hooks and learn how to test them Use community Hooks for implementing responsive design and more Learn the limitations of Hooks and what you should and shouldn’t use them for Get to grips with implementing React context using Hooks Refactor your React-based web application, replacing existing React class components with Hooks Use state management solutions such as Redux and MobX with React Hooks Who this book is for This book is for React developers who want to learn how to build applications with Hooks.

In terms of React Native, the book has been updated to version 0.62 and demonstrates how to apply native UI components for your existing mobile apps using NativeBase. You will begin by learning about the essential building blocks of React components. Next, you’ll progress to working with higher-level functionalities in application development, before putting this knowledge to use by developing user interface components for the web and for native platforms. In the concluding chapters, you’ll learn how to bring your application together with a robust data architecture. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build React applications for the web and React Native applications for multiple mobile platforms. What you will learn Delve into the React architecture, component properties, state, and context Get to grips with React Hooks for handling functions and components Implement code splitting in React using lazy components and Suspense Build robust user interfaces for mobile and desktop apps using Material-UI Write shared components for Android and iOS mobile apps using React Native Simplify layout design for React Native apps using NativeBase Write GraphQL schemas to power web and mobile apps Implement web and mobile components that are driven by Apollo Who this book is for This book is for any JavaScript developer who wants to start learning how to use Facebook’s UI libraries, React and React Native, for mobile and web application development.

The Last Day of Winter will educate you about potential barriers you may encounter while either providing or receiving needed care and support. Personal stories of triumph, isolation, fear, and grief are shared-equipping you with the knowledge that you are not alone on your journey.The Last Day of Winter will help you understand the importance of the relationship between you and the cycle of life-and between you and your loved one as you face the last day of winter together.",

This book explores the React library in depth, as well as detailing additional tools and libraries in the React ecosystem, enabling you to create complete, complex applications. You will learn how to use React completely, and learn best practices for creating interfaces in a composable way. You will also cover additional tools and libraries in the React ecosystem (such as React Router and Flux architecture). Each topic is covered clearly and concisely and is packed with the details you need to learn to be truly effective. The most important features are given no-nonsense, in-depth treatment, and every chapter details common problems and how to avoid them. If you already have experience creating front-end apps using jQuery or perhaps other JavaScript frameworks, but need to solve the increasingly common problem of structuring complex front-end applications, then this book is for you. Start working with React like a pro - add Pro React to your library today.",

                "description": "You may have picked up this book with some level of JavaScript knowledge. There is also a high probability that you have an idea of what React js is. This chapter highlights the key aspects of React as a framework, explains the problems it solves, and describes how you can utilize the features and the rest of the information contained in this book to better your web development practices and create complex, yet maintainable user interfaces using React.Defining React jsReact js is a JavaScript framework. React was originally created by engineers at Facebook to solve the challenges involved when developing complex user interfaces with datasets that change over time. This is not a trivial undertaking and must not only be maintainable, but also scalable to work at the scale of Facebook. React js was actually born in Facebook's ads organization, where they had been utilizing a traditional client-side Model-View-Controller approach. Applications such as these normally consist of two-way data binding along with rendering template. React changed the way that these applications were created by making some daring advances in web development. When React js was released in 2013, the web development community was both interested and seemingly disgusted by what React was doing. As you will discover throughout this book, React challenges conventions that have become the de-facto standards for JavaScript framework best practices. React does this by introducing many new paradigms and shifting the status quo of what it takes to create scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications and user interfaces. Along with the shift in front-end development mentality, React comes with a rich set of features that make composing a single-page application or user interface approachable for developers of many skill levels-from those who have just been introduced to JavaScript, to seasoned veterans of the web. You will see these features-such as the virtual DOM, JSX, and Flux concepts-as you read this book and discover how they can be used to create complex user interfaces.You will also see, in brief, how Facebook is continually challenging the development world with React Native. React Native is a new open source library for creating native user interfaces utilizing the same principles as React's JavaScript library. By creating a Native UI library, React has pushed its value proposition of \"learn once, write anywhere.\" This paradigm shift applies to being able to utilize the core concepts of React in order to make maintainable interfaces. By now it is possible you are thinking that there is nothing React can't do when it comes to development. This is not the case, and in order to further understand what React is, you need an understanding of what React is not, which you learn later in this chapter. First, you will understand the underlying problems that caused React to be created and how React solves those problems.",

No knowledge of React is needed, though a working knowledge of ES2015 will help you follow along better. What You Will Learn Craft reusable React components Control navigation using the React Router to help keep your UI in sync with URLs Build isomorphic web applications using Node.js Use the Flexbox layout model to create responsive mobile designs Leverage the native APIs of Android and iOS to build engaging applications with React Native Respond to gestures in a way that's intuitive for the user Use Relay to build a unified data architecture for your React UIs In Detail React and React Native allow you to build cross-platform desktop and mobile applications using Facebook's innovative UI libraries. Combined with the Flux data architecture and Relay, you can now create powerful and feature-complete applications from just one code base! This book is split into three parts. The first part shows you how to start crafting composable UIs using React, from rendering with JSX and creating reusable components through to routing and creating isomorphic applications that run on Node. We then move on to showing you how to take the concepts of React and apply them to building Native UIs using React Native. You'll find out how to build responsive and streamlined UIs that can properly handle user interactions in a mobile environment. You'll also learn how to access device-specific APIs such as the geolocation API, and how to handle offline development with React Native. Finally, we'll tie all of these skills together and shows you how you can create React applications that run on every major platform. As well as understanding application state in depth, you'll learn how to leverage Relay to make feature-complete, data-driven web and native mobile applications. Style and approach Split into three major sections to help organize your learning, this hands-on, code-first book will help you get up to speed with React and React Native—the UI framework that powers Netflix, Yahoo, and Facebook.",

In a nutshell, it's made it easier for developers to build interactive user interfaces for web, mobile and desktop platforms. One of its best features is its freedom from the problematic bugs inherent in MVC frameworks, where inconsistent views is a recurring problem for big projects. Today, thousands of companies worldwide are using React, including big names such as Netflix and AirBnB. React has become immensely popular, such that a number of apps have been ported to React -- including WhatsApp, Instagram and Dropbox. This book is a collection of tutorials, selected from SitePoint's React Hub, that will guide you through your first days with the amazingly flexible library.",

The React philosophy is to focus solely on the user interface. In model-view-controller (MVC) terminology, React is the view. Because it has to work with models and other libraries, it's designed to play nicely with pretty much any other framework, router, style, and model library. And it's well-supported—React emerged from Instagram and is now used by Facebook, Asana, Khan Academy, and Atom among many more. React Quickly is for anyone who wants to learn React.js fast. This hands-on book teaches needed concepts by using lots of examples, tutorials, and a large main project that gets built throughout. It starts with the basics, including how React fits into applications, JSX, and handling states, and events. Next, it explores core topics like components, forms, and data. Finally, the book dives into React integration topics, like unit testing and isomorphic JavaScript with Express.js, and Gulp. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.",

You'll begin with a solid foundation of practical knowledge, and then build on it immediately by constructing three different apps. You'll learn how to use each feature of React Native by working on two full projects and one full game. These aren’t just simple React Native Hello World examples (although you’ll naturally start there!) but are apps that you can, if you so choose, install on your mobile devices and use for real. Throughout this book, you'll gain real-world familiarity with React Native as well as supporting components from Expo, NativeBase, React Navigation and the Redux and Lodash libraries. You'll also build server-side code for a mobile React Native app to talk to using the popular Node.js and Socket.io library, providing you a holistic view of things even beyond React Native. And, you'll see many helpful tips, tricks and gotchas to watch out for along the way! Practical React Native offers practical exercises that will give you a solid grasp of building apps with React Native, allowing you to springboard into creating more advanced apps on your own.Creating a game with React Native will allow you to see a whole other perspective on what React Native can do. What You'll Learn Master the basics of React Native Create a logically structured project Review interface elements, such as widgets, controls, and extensions Build layouts Work with Expo, an open source toolchain Who This book Is For The primary audience is mobile developers and anyone looking to build for multiple mobile platforms and trying to do so with a codebase that is largely the same across all. Readers will need a decent foundation, but not necessarily be experts in, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'll assume little beyond that.",
